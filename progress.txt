- Set up navigation with basic styling
- Verified app builds successfully with npm run build
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed: web/ (all files in new directory)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Web app is scaffolded in web/ directory with standard Vite + React + TypeScript structure
  - Routes are configured in App.tsx using react-router-dom
  - Environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be accessible in the app
  - npm run build runs both typecheck (tsc -b) and production build
