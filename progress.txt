## 2026-01-19T01:35:40.606Z - US-001
- Implemented React + Vite + TypeScript web app under web/ directory
- Added react-router-dom for routing with placeholder screens for Home, Camera, History, Settings, and Login
- Created .env and .env.example files for VITE_API_BASE_URL configuration
- Set up navigation with basic styling
- Verified app builds successfully with npm run build
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed: web/ (all files in new directory)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Web app is scaffolded in web/ directory with standard Vite + React + TypeScript structure
  - Routes are configured in App.tsx using react-router-dom
  - Environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be accessible in the app
  - npm run build runs both typecheck (tsc -b) and production build
