## 2026-01-19T01:35:40.606Z - US-001
- Implemented React + Vite + TypeScript web app under web/ directory
- Added react-router-dom for routing with placeholder screens for Home, Camera, History, Settings, and Login
- Created .env and .env.example files for VITE_API_BASE_URL configuration
- Set up navigation with basic styling
- Verified app builds successfully with npm run build
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed: web/ (all files in new directory)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Web app is scaffolded in web/ directory with standard Vite + React + TypeScript structure
  - Routes are configured in App.tsx using react-router-dom
  - Environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be accessible in the app
  - npm run build runs both typecheck (tsc -b) and production build

## 2026-01-19T01:40:39.459Z - US-002
- Translated AppTheme.swift colors and gradients into CSS variables in web/src/styles/theme.css
- Created mobile-first base styles in web/src/styles/base.css with typography, spacing, and utilities
- Built shared UI primitives: Card, Button, SectionHeader components
- Updated App.tsx and App.css to use new theme tokens
- Demonstrated theme on Home page with gradient cards and buttons
- Verified in browser at localhost:5173
- Typecheck and build passing
- Files changed: web/src/styles/theme.css, web/src/styles/base.css, web/src/components/ui/*.tsx, web/src/App.css, web/src/App.tsx, web/src/main.tsx, web/src/pages/Home.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Theme uses CSS variables for all colors, spacing, typography
  - All type-only imports must use 'import type' syntax due to verbatimModuleSyntax
  - Gradient cards numbered 1-4 correspond to iOS cardGradients array
  - UI components are in web/src/components/ui with co-located CSS files
  - Dev server runs on port 5173

## 2026-01-19T01:44:45.000Z - US-003
- Implemented typed API client in web/src/services/api.ts
- Created ApiClient class with GET, POST, and postFormData methods
- Implemented automatic Authorization header attachment from localStorage
- Surfaced backend error messages through ApiError interface
- Exposed authApi (register, login), userApi (getStats), and mealApi (analyze, getMeals) functions
- Build and typecheck passing
- Files changed: web/src/services/api.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - API client reads VITE_API_BASE_URL from environment, defaults to localhost:3001
  - Auth token stored in localStorage under 'authToken' key
  - FormData endpoints don't set Content-Type header (browser sets with boundary)
  - Error handling extracts message from backend response.message or response.error
  - All API methods are typed with TypeScript interfaces

## 2026-01-19T01:46:52.000Z - US-004
- Implemented AuthContext with React Context API for auth state management
- Created AuthProvider component that stores token and guest/authenticated state
- Auth state loads from localStorage on app startup
- Provided login, register, logout, and enterGuestMode actions
- Updated API client to handle 401 responses via setApiUnauthorizedHandler
- Integrated AuthProvider into App.tsx with automatic logout and redirect on 401
- Build and typecheck passing
- Files changed: web/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx (new), web/src/services/api.ts, web/src/App.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Auth token stored in localStorage under 'authToken' key
  - Guest mode flag stored under 'guestMode' key
  - AuthContext exposes isAuthenticated, isGuest, and isLoading flags
  - 401 handling uses callback pattern to avoid circular dependencies
  - Must use type-only imports for React types due to verbatimModuleSyntax
  - AuthProvider wraps BrowserRouter, AppContent uses useNavigate for 401 redirects
