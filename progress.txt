## 2026-01-13T03:15 - US-001
- Added User model to Prisma schema with id, email (unique), passwordHash, name, createdAt
- Made MealAnalysis.userId nullable for backward compatibility
- Added index on MealAnalysis.userId
- Added relation between User and MealAnalysis
- Generated and ran migration 20260113031542_add_user_model
- Files changed: backend/prisma/schema.prisma, backend/prisma/migrations/
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Prisma schema uses cuid() for default IDs
  - Relations require both field and reference declarations
  - Migrations created with `npx prisma migrate dev --name <name>`
  - Always make userId nullable when adding to existing tables for backward compatibility
